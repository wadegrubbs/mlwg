    <h1>Jim Is A Very Fine Cat</h1>
    <img src=jim.jpg>
    <h2>Jim indulges in many activities including</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Occupying the couch</li>
        <li>Watching football</li>
        <li>Judging cat food varieties</li>
        <li>Listening to me ponder the inequites of life</li>
      </ul>
    <h2>Jim will voice his concern:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>When our other cat Ambrose enters the room</li>
        <li>When being accidentally sat on</li>
        <li>When his litter box has not been primped and freshened</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Jim is a little old man with three legs and failing kidneys, so he's probably not long for this mortal coil. Too bad. He is finest company and all cats should take a note from his friendly and pleasant demeanor.</p>
